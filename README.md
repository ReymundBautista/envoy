Various front-end proxy Envoy configurations that I've been experimenting with.

## Requirements
I've been running these configurations on MacOS Catalina. You'll want to ensure that the following tools are installed:

* `curl`
* `docker-compose`
* `openssl`
* `Docker Desktop`
* `make`

## Current configurations
* [shadow](shadow)
* [sni-match](sni-match)
* [tls-terminate](tls-terminate)
